# RDF4J Integration

This folder contains the necessary files to interact with the RDF4J reasoner service using the [RDF4J adapter](./src/README.md), a SHACL-based semantic reasoning engine used in this project.

## How to Use RDF4J

For instructions on how to start the RDF4J service required for this project, see [this guide](/docker/rdf4j/README.md).

### RDF Triple Assembler

See how to interact with the RDF4J server using the [RDF assembler](/cdsp/knowledge-layer/connector/json-rdf-convertor/rdf-writer/README.md). This module is designed to transform structured data messages into RDF triples, providing a streamlined way to produce linked data for knowledge graphs, ontologies, or semantic applications.
